# Introduction

This project is form the Kaggle competition where the data from the Home Credit is provided for finding the Home Credit Loan Default risk. Home Credit is dedicated to enhancing financial inclusion for the unbanked population, striving to provide a positive and secure borrowing experience. To ensure a favorable loan experience for this underserved demographic, Home Credit employs alternative data, including telco and transactional information, to assess clients' repayment capacities. 

Although Home Credit currently utilizes various statistical and machine learning methods for predictions, they are inviting Kagglers to assist them in fully unleashing the potential of their data. This collaborative effort aims to prevent the rejection of clients capable of repayment to meet that financial gap in the society.

# Business Problem

The business problem for the Home Credit Default risk analysis project is to fully harness the potential of the available data to predict client repayment behavior. The core business challenge for Home Credit is to precisely forecast the probability of the target variable, enabling them to extend their services to the broadest possible user base. So the Goal is to develop a model that predicts the whether the loan applicant is at a risk to default the loan or not.

To combine all the points the business problem in an overall sense is to find the customers who are likely to default and also finding the customers and their traits who have high repayment abilities.

# Project Objective

The project's primary objective is to develop a high-performance predictive model for the target variable using client-provided data, thereby facilitating business expansion.
