# Introduction

This project is form the Kaggle competition where the data from the Home Credit is provided for finding the Home Credit Loan Default risk. Home Credit is dedicated to enhancing financial inclusion for the unbanked population, striving to provide a positive and secure borrowing experience. To ensure a favorable loan experience for this underserved demographic, Home Credit employs alternative data, including telco and transactional information, to assess clients' repayment capacities. 

Although Home Credit currently utilizes various statistical and machine learning methods for predictions, they are inviting Kagglers to assist them in fully unleashing the potential of their data. This collaborative effort aims to prevent the rejection of clients capable of repayment and ensure that loans are structured with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that empowers clients to achieve success.
